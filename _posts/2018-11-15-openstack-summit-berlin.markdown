### OpenStack Summit Berlin 2018 Recap

Today marks the end of yet another awesome [OpenStack Summit][summit], this
time held in the gorgeous city of Berlin, Germany. Those of us fortunate
enough to attend were treated to the latest & greatest updates of what's
happening with OpenStack - with one particularly exciting announcement being
that the next summit is getting a name change! OpenStack Summit is now being
rebranded as the **Open Infrastructure Summit**, colocated with [OpenStack
PTG][ptg] in Denver, CO from April 29th to May 4th, 2019. This summit also
marked a milestone for me, as I was given opportunity by our awesome OpenStack
community to __successfully__ deliver a clean demo on installing [OpenShift on
OpenStack][ooo123].

### Demo Video

For those who missed it, you can view the video on [YouTube][demo]. Once I've
returned to the U.S. & recovered from this heinous jetlag, a new blog will be
uploaded with more details on the demo environment, & how it can be replicated
to create your own OpenShift-on-OpenStack playground.

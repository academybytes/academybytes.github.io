Just as I promised in an older post, I will be using this here blogspace as a
sort of checkin spot to hold myself accountable for whatever I have (or
haven't) done in working towards RHCA certification. 

### Step 1 - Starting Again

The first thing I did was schedule an exam - one that I've been putting off
for an embarrassingly long time. So long, in fact, that the exam has been
replaced & will officially go away in 2019. On August 23rd, I will sit for the
Red Hat Certified Engineer in Red Hat OpenStack exam & hopefully move a toe
closer to my goal.

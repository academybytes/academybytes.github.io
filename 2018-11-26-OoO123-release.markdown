For those who caught the **OpenShift on OpenStack** bug at [OpenStack Summit Berlin][summit] & want to know more, check out my latest Linux Academy course - aptly named [OpenShift on OpenStack][ooo123]! 

![graphic](./_posts/images/Openshift-on-OpenStack-1920x1080.png)

You'll get a full walkthrough on how to quickly deploy your own OpenStack Queens cloud using **OpenStack PackStack**, then launch an OpenShift cluster with Keystone, Cinder, & Neutron integrations using [Keith Tenzer's][ktenzer] OpenShift-on-OpenStack123 playbooks. Once your OoO123 cluster is running, we'll practice OpenShift migrations, disaster recovery, & more. 

If you don't have a Linux Academy subscription yet, now is a GREAT time to sign up to take advantage of 33% off [#CyberMonday][sale] deals, so what are you waiting for??

If you follow me on the [Twitters][twitter] (which I certainly hope you do)
you may have recently seen a tweet/subtle cry for help where I mentioned being afraid
to leave the house for an event. As mentioned on Twitter, I was ultimately
glad that I went, but getting out the door following [Open Source Summit North
America][ossna] was much harder than usual.

I've made peace with the fact that I'm a true introvert who needs long
"recharge periods" in-between social events, but I was a bit caught off-guard
by my body's reaction to the idea of being in a room, _with people_ , far away
from the safety of my domicile. It was kind of funny in hindsight -- but it
got me thinking about others who face the same struggles when it comes to
social anxiety. Not everyone succeeds at pushing aside that nagging voice in the
back of your head that's telling you that you're going to die & your pupper
will starve to death if you leave. Heck, most of the time Nagging Voice wins
if for no other reason than watching another rerun episode of The Simpsons is
more appealing than constantly pondering if people are secretly laughing at
the way I sometimes stutter or my lazy eye (sn: I don't have a lazy eye). Fortunately for me, I have a wonderful little Pupper companion who quickly & expertly mutes Nagging Voice in situations where he's allowed. Unfortunately in this specific situation, I couldn't bring him. Sadly, emotional support animals are not covered under the ADA, even when prescribed by a doctor.

I suppose there's no real point to this, except to say "I hear you, friend."
to all of the other Hardcore Introverts out there. Living with anxiety is...
interesting, to say the least.
